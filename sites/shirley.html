                <p class="readmore-target">At its inception, KDL inherited just under 100 digital
                    research projects and websites. Aware of the intellectual and cultural value of
                    many of these projects, with the support of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities
                    at King’s College London, KDL took on its responsibility to the community to
                    steward them in a responsible manner. When the options of setting up a <a

        <h5>Overview</h5>
        <p>The <em>The Complete Works of James Shirley</em> is the online complement to the print
            version of <em>The Complete Works of James Shirley</em>, a multi-volume scholarly
            edition begun with Arts and Humanities Research Council funding in 2007 and representing
            a collaboration between the Universities of Durham, Anglia Ruskin, and Warwick along
            with the Oxford University Press. James Shirley (1596-1666) was a significant dramatic
            writer of the late English Renaissance and the project is the first time of editing his
            complete oeuvre - a corpus of around 50 works, including plays, poems, and prose.</p>
        <p>The online edition complements the modernised-spelling print edition by offering
            authoritative original-spelling texts of Shirley's works. Development of the website was
            begun by staff at the Department of Digital Humanities at King's College London and
            completed King's Digital Lab. The application was built using the Kiln framework.</p>
