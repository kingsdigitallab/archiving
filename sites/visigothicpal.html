            <p class="readmore-target">At its inception, KDL inherited just under 100 digital research projects and websites. Aware of the intellectual and cultural value of many of these projects, with the support of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King’s College London, KDL took on its responsibility to the community to steward them in a responsible manner. When the options of setting up a <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/how-we-work/why-work-us/">Service Level Agreement </a> for further hosting and maintenance with KDL and/or undertaking migration to IT Services at King’s or other institutions were deemed infeasible or inappropriate, the archiving process was initiated.</p>
            <p class="readmore-target">We would like to thank research leads, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King’s College London, and partner institutions, for their support in this process.

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>VisigothicPal was the digital counterpart of the project "ViGOTHIC: Towards a typology of Visigothic script: the Beatus British Library Add. ms. 11695 and its potential for dating and localising Visigothic script manuscripts"</p>
    <p>As a pilot project for the digital analysis of Visigothic script, the study built on a case study: the copy of the Apocalypse of Beatus of Liébana kept at the British Library (BL Add. Ms. 11695) as one of the few codices written in this script that can be dated and geographically located with certainty. The systematic analysis of this codex helped evaluate computer-assisted techniques to the study of this particular written system, determining the viability and benefits of computerised semi-automated analysis. VisigothicPal aimed to establish a point of reference for computerised analysis of Visigothic script sources by providing accurate graphic foundations to foster historical research.</p>
    <p>At the time of decommissioning, VisigothicPal contained: 21 records of manuscripts and charters; 112 manuscript images; 2593 images of letters (graphs).</p>
    <p>The project is expected to migrate to another host in the course of 2020.</p>
