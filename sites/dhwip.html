        <p>This site has been archived as part of <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk">King's Digital Lab</a> (KDL) archiving and sustainability process, following background analysis and consultation with research leads wherever possible. </p>
        <p>Project content and data has been stored as a fully backed-up Virtual Machine and can be made available on request (depending on access controls agreed with the Principal Investigator) for a period of at least 2 years from the decommissioning date indicated below.

        <div class="note">
            <p class="readmore-target">At its inception, KDL inherited just under 100 digital research projects and websites. Aware of the intellectual and cultural value of many of these projects, with the support of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King’s College London, KDL took on its responsibility to the community to steward them in a responsible manner. When the options of setting up a <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/how-we-work/why-work-us/">Service Level Agreement </a> for further hosting and maintenance with KDL and/or undertaking migration to IT Services at King’s or other institutions were deemed infeasible or inappropriate, the archiving process was initiated.</p>
            <p class="readmore-target">We would like to thank research leads, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King’s College London, and partner institutions, for their support in this process.
            </p>

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>This blog was for professional and academic reflection on the Digital Humanities, construed in its widest possible sense. Most of the authors and administrators of this site were associated in some way with the Department of Digital Humanities at King’s College London (staff, former staff, project partners) but, and although DDH also hosted this site, it was not an official mouthpiece of the Department or of the College; opinions expressed were those of the authors and should in no way be taken as representing those of the DDH as a whole or of its other members.</p>
    <p>We wanted to promote an open, constructive and transparent online debate about everything that DH practitioners thought relevant to the various aspects of the discipline. For this reason, the administrators would never censor or edit academic and relevant posts or comments. (Obviously spam and such irrelevant material would be deleted as a matter of course.) However we did expect that all contributors would follow the usual etiquette of online discourse: no personal attacks, defamation, etc.</p>
