            <p class="readmore-target">At its inception, KDL inherited just under 100 digital research projects and websites. Aware of the intellectual and cultural value of many of these projects, with the support of the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King’s College London, KDL took on its responsibility to the community to steward them in a responsible manner. When the options of setting up a <a href="https://www.kdl.kcl.ac.uk/how-we-work/why-work-us/">Service Level Agreement </a> for further hosting and maintenance with KDL and/or undertaking migration to IT Services at King’s or other institutions were deemed infeasible or inappropriate, the archiving process was initiated.</p>
            <p class="readmore-target">We would like to thank research leads, the Faculty of Arts and Humanities at King’s College London, and partner institutions, for their support in this process.

    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>Mapping Migration is constructing a Geographical Information System (GIS) and web-site focussing on the forced migration of people from 1880 to the present day in the geographical region of Macedonia now known as the district of Kastoria, Greece.</p>
    <p>The partners are the
        <a href="https://www.rsc.ox.ac.uk">Refugee Studies Centre</a>, University of Oxford, <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/artshums/depts/ddh/index.aspx">Centre for Computing in the Humanities</a>, King's College London and <a href="http://www.macedonian-heritage.gr/institutions.html#crmhd">The Research Centre for Macedonian History and Documentation</a>, Thessaloniki.</p>
    <p>The content of the web site is drawn from a collection of material consisting of historical documents, photographs (both contemporary and historical), postcards, short explanatory texts, demographic metadata in databases concerning about one hundred and twenty communities and multimedia presentations of places, historical events and cultural phenomena.</p>
    <p>The Project focuses on a section of the geography region of Macedonia, more precisely the district of Kastoria, part of the Monastir Vilayet during the Ottoman empire, named prefecture of Kastoria and Florina when incorporated within the Greek state (1913), then becoming district of Kastoria following the end of the Second World War and the Greek Civil War (1948).</p>
